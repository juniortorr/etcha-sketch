A javascript based project, showcasing dom manipulation
Hi! This is my third or fourth javascript project in The Odin Project curriculum.
It shows how we can manipulate the DOM to display div's on a grid system 
that the user will select via a prompt. It then will resize, and fill in 
where the users cursor hovers. The user can then reset the page to a new size
with a reset button
